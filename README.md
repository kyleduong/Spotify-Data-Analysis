# Introduction
When people asked me my music type, I always gave a vague answer like "all types" because thats what I geniunely thought my music type was. However, I wanted to dig deeper and find the true nature of my music type.
I also wanted to see how similar my music taste was to my close friend.

# Goals
- What are the standout characteristics of the music I add? (Any outliers?)
- How has my music taste evolved over time?
- Which genres do I listen to most often?
- What is my average song duration, and does it change over time?
- What is the overall popularity of my music?
- What aspects of music do my friend and I have in common?
