# Introduction
When people asked me my music type, I always gave a vague answer like "all types" because thats what I geniunely thought my music type was. However, I wanted to dig deeper and find the true nature of my music type.
Throughout my data exploration for insights into my "music type", I uncovered that the music I listen to is quite popular compared to other people, so this inspired me to uncover data for prospective artists, to find out what aspects of music led to high streaming/popularity and success overall.


# Goals
- What are the standout characteristics of the music I add? (Any outliers?)
- How has my music taste evolved over time?
- Which genres do I listen to most often?
- What is my average song duration, and does it change over time?
- What is the overall popularity of my music?
- What aspects of music do my friend and I have in common?
